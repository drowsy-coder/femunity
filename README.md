      <p>😓 We discovered that a lot of our peers were hesitant to go on community based social media apps due to prevalent NSFW content and/or due to facing harrasement and misogynistic atmosphere. </p>
       <p>📝 We also conducted a survey to get community response for some sought after features listed below.</p>

## 📊 Public Opinion

#### 597 students surveyed across 6️⃣ colleges in India

- The Form was circulated carefully to ensure that the intended demographic received it.
- Best efforts to ensure that only respondents who identify as female are polled.

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <p>➡️ Along with building a progressive community, we realised that we could also provide a platform to increase awarness about opportunities and scolarships. We came to this conclusion after observing that a lot of our peers were either unaware or confused by things like Google STEP Intern/Generation Scholar, TalentSprint WE, International Research Opportuntiies etc. </p>
    <p>➡️ After a classmate faced a risky situation online due to limited knowledge about digtal security, we also decided to implement a Safety Section where our users can learn about best methods to be digitally secure and also access SoS features when needed.</p>
